- Size: 650 students, grades 6-8
- Demographics: 45% free/reduced lunch, 32% ELL
- Challenge: 73% of essays showing AI use, teacher morale crisis

**Timeline: September - December 2024**

### The Problem
Teachers were spending countless hours trying to "catch" AI use, creating an adversarial relationship with students. The "gotcha" approach was failing:
- Students became more sophisticated at hiding AI use
- Trust between teachers and students eroded
- Writing instruction time decreased by 40%
- 16 of 24 teachers on improvement plans due to "poor classroom management"

### The Intervention
**Week 1: Mindset Shift**
- 3-day training for all teachers using this curriculum
- Principal mandate: "No punishment for past AI use"
- Creation of school-wide AI task force

**Week 2-4: Implementation**
- Students taught AI literacy in all classes
- Transparent AI policies posted in every room
- Parent information night (112 attendees)
- New assessment rubrics focusing on process

### Measurable Results (After 3 Months)
